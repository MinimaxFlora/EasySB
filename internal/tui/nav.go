// What is left of the former left-hand navigation lives here. Every page of the
// panel now uses the same two-box frame (the page's 看板 over its entries), and a
// section is left with Esc the way a submenu is, so only two helpers remain:
// sectionID, which says which root entry the panel is inside, and padLines, which
// clips and fills a box.

// sectionID is the root entry the panel is currently inside, or "" on the main
// menu. The section is recorded when a root entry is entered; a stack that was
// assembled another way (tests, restored state) still resolves through the menu
// ids, which repeat their root node id.
