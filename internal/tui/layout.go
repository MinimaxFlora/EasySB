// The panel's layout is fixed: the same two boxes, in the same rows, on every page.
//
// The numbers come from the main page, because that is the page an operator sees first and
// the one they asked every other page to match. Before this, a section whose board was taller
// than its room dropped the board entirely and let its menu box grow to fill the screen, so
// every page had its own box sizes and the panel jumped as the operator moved through it.
//
// The slots are:
//
//	┌ 看板 ┐   l.board rows, borders included
//	          l.gap blank rows
//	┌ 菜单 ┐   l.menu rows, borders included
//	· 说明                    l.tail rows: the description line and the key hints
//	┌ 提示 ┐
//
// A page with more content than a slot has room for clips it inside the slot instead of
// growing, and says how much it left out; nothing in the panel scrolls behind a key.

//
// The account detail page lists twelve operations, which is taller on purpose: it is a page of
// actions rather than a list of peers, and dashboard.go lays a page that has outgrown one entry
