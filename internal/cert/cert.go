// Package cert resolves the TLS certificate of the sing-box server: a Let's
// Encrypt certificate the panel issues itself over the HTTP-01 challenge, or a
// self-signed placeholder for as long as none has been issued.
//
// Issuance used to be a shell dependency: acme.sh, downloaded and installed at
// runtime, with socat or python to answer the challenge. Both are gone. The panel
// is one static binary and now speaks ACME itself through
// github.com/go-acme/lego/v5, so a minimal image needs neither a downloaded
// script nor a second interpreter, and there is no version of either that can
// drift from what this package reads. Everything the panel used to parse out of
// acme.sh's log output ("Domains not changed", "Next renewal time is", "Renew
// success") is now a value this package knows first hand: an account resource, a
// certificate resource and the expiry of the leaf that is on disk.
//
// The layout under Dir() is the panel's own:
//
//	<dir>/account.key      the ACME account key, 0600
//	<dir>/account.json     the account URL the CA handed back, 0600
//	<dir>/<domain>/fullchain.cer   the issued leaf plus its chain, 0644
//	<dir>/<domain>/private.key     its private key, 0600
