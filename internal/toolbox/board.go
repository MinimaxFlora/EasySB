// benchmark or a set of unlock probes, and an operator comparing two hosts — or coming back
// the next morning — should not have to run everything again because the panel was closed in
// between. The board is a cache of measurements, never a source of truth: a tool that has not
// run in this session still says 尚未检测 when its record is missing.
