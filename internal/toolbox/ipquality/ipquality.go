// Package ipquality reports what the host's public IPv4 address looks like from the
// outside: which free databases agree on where it is and who announces it, what kind of
// line it sits on, and whether the common DNS blocklists answer for it.
//
// The panel needs this before it can promise much. "Why is this node blocked" usually
// begins with an address that a dozen blocklists already answer for, or one registered
// to a datacenter in a country the operator did not expect. Everything here is somebody
// else's reading, so four rules shape the package:
//
//   - A database that does not answer becomes a failure carrying its reason (timeout,
//     rate limit, HTTP status, missing field). No field is ever filled in from another
//     database, and a failed row carries no values at all.
//   - The line-kind verdict is folded from the databases' own claims, never from a
//     heuristic on their prose. Two databases that disagree produce 不一致, and both
//     sides are printed; there is no majority vote.
//   - A blocklist that answers is a hit, NXDOMAIN is a clean miss, and anything else
//     (timeout, a query the zone refuses to answer for a public resolver) is reported
//     as unreached rather than as either verdict.
//   - Every request goes through toolbox.Options.HTTP() and every DNS query through an
//     injected Resolver, so the tests run without a network.
//
// Only free, keyless endpoints are used. The panel ships to an operator's VPS and must
// not need an account, and a key compiled into the binary would be spent by whoever
// reads it first. That is also why a database whose detection flags need a free key
// (ipapi.is) contributes only what its keyless answer carries, and says so in a note.
