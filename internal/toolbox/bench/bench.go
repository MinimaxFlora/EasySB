// Package bench measures what this host can do: a CPU score, memory bandwidth and disk
// throughput. It is the panel's own answer to the "CPU 跑分 / 内存 / 磁盘 dd" block of the
// familiar VPS review scripts, and one rule decides everything else in here:
//
//   - Nothing is downloaded and nothing outside the standard library is executed. A fresh
//     VPS has no sysbench, no fio and no dd worth calling, and the panel promises a single
//     static binary. Every number below comes from loops this process runs itself.
//
// The price of that rule is comparability, and the results pay it out loud: a score here
// means "work retired per second of this panel version's own fixed workload". It is
// meaningful against another run of the same panel build on another host, and it is not a
// sysbench, fio, dd or Geekbench number. Every result's notes say so; do not reword that
// away, because an operator who reads 1200 MB/s here as "my NVMe does 1200 MB/s" has been
// misled by a number that also depends on the filesystem, on the page cache and on how
// busy the box was.
//
// Two rules come from the toolbox contract:
//
//   - The workload is fixed and small enough to finish, so a slow host measures for longer
//     instead of measuring something else. Where an input must be sized (the disk test,
//     which must not fill a small VPS), the size actually used is reported and the reason
//     for shrinking it is a note.
//   - Every measured loop leaves behind an accumulator that reaches the result. The
//     compiler is then not free to delete the loop, and a reader can compare two runs
//     value by value.
