// behaviour — stream to a file, report the bytes to the interface, give up after a
// budget: the panel's own release (internal/update) and the BBR kernel packages
// (internal/bbr). The sing-box core is no longer among them: it is a compiled-in
// module requirement, so there is no core tarball to fetch, unpack or install.
