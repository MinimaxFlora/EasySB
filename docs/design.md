# Design Principles

These are the decisions that shape the codebase. When a change conflicts with
one of them, treat the change as a design discussion rather than a local edit.

## Single static binary

Everything except the sing-box core is compiled in, certificates included.
There is no
runtime package manager call on the hot path and no script interpreter needed to
issue a certificate either.
The binary is invoked as `sb` after `install.sh` links it.

## Legacy-compatible state

`/etc/sing-box/easysb.conf` keeps the KV layout of the old bash tool. A Go build
and a shell build can inspect the same deployment. Do not change existing keys;
add new ones instead. The exception is a key that only described a component
which no longer exists: v4 dropped `SUB_PORT` and `SUB_PATH` in the same change
that deleted the nginx site they configured, because an unread key is dead
weight. Removing a key requires removing its component and updating every doc
that mentions it.

## Templates are readable first

`templates/` holds JSONC that a human can read and copy. Comments are allowed
there even though sing-box itself would reject them; the tool strips comments
when it renders a real config. The subscription templates that ship inside the
binary are `internal/subscribe/tun-fakeip.json` and `internal/subscribe/mihomo.yaml`;
the readable mirrors are `templates/config/tun-fakeip.json` and
`templates/config/mihomo.yaml`.

## Bilingual by construction

Every user-facing string flows through `internal/i18n`. The language is a
`Lang` value (`C` or `E`), never a global boolean. `L` toggles at runtime. New
strings must be added to the table for both languages in the same commit.

## Version is data, not code

`VERSION` is the single source of truth, and it is compiled into the binary with
`go:embed`. A bare `go build` and a published release therefore report the same
number, with no `-ldflags -X main.version` to keep in step and no second constant
to drift. The workflow publishes under the tag `v<VERSION>`; `install.sh` reads
the in-tree file when it runs inside a checkout and otherwise asks GitHub for the
latest release tag; `internal/update` derives the same tag from the remote
version. Never hardcode a release tag in more than one place.

## Non-interactive entry points

Anything a boot unit needs must be reachable without a TTY. `--apply-firewall`
is the model case: it loads state, applies rules, writes the unit, and exits.
The TUI calls the same package functions.

## Dark, quiet terminal UI

The default palette is dark with cyan as the primary accent. On startup the TUI
asks the terminal for its background color and switches to a darkened light
palette when the background is light, so the near-white body text of the dark
palette never lands on white; `--theme` (or `EASYSB_THEME`) forces `dark` or
`light`. The UI uses the alternate screen, one border, and one accent per state
(ok / warn / error). Spacing is
explicit: dividers and menu items each get exactly one blank line, and the
dashboard drops low-priority panels before it overflows a short terminal.

## One frame, two boxes

Every page is the same shape: a status strip on the first line, then the page's own
看板 in the top box and its entries in the bottom one. The main menu and a section
differ only in what those two boxes hold — the wordmark and the 看板 of the panel
versus the 看板 of one section — so moving between pages never resizes the frame and
the key hints never move. A section is left with `Esc`, the way a submenu is, and
`--render --screen <id>` draws any of them for a layout check.

## Long operations report where they are

A task that downloads something streams its readings to the screen instead of
printing a line per megabyte: `internal/download` reports byte counts through a
`Progress` callback, `internal/tui` collects them in the task reporter and draws a
bar above the log. Anything that can take minutes — the panel's own binary, a
kernel package — goes through that path, and a step that only changes local state
stays silent rather than showing a bar that never moves. The core is not on that
list any more: it is compiled in, so nothing about the node downloads.

## Direct downloads, tolerant parsing

Deployment targets are overseas hosts with direct GitHub access, so binary and
kernel-package downloads go straight to `github.com` with no mirror prefix. Release
tag parsing still tolerates a missing `v` prefix, because the `releases.atom` feed
omits it.
