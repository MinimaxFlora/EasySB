# EasySB Engineering Docs

This directory is the fast path for other agents and contributors to understand
EasySB without reading the whole tree. Keep it short, factual, and current.

| Document | What it answers |
| :--- | :--- |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | Where the code lives, what each module owns, how data flows |
| [design.md](design.md) | Why the project is shaped this way |
| [core-builds.md](core-builds.md) | The sing-box core compiled into the panel, the build tag set, `core run` / `core check` |
| [user-management.md](user-management.md) | Accounts, the subscription service and usage accounting (the v5 model) |
| [toolbox.md](toolbox.md) | The measurement tools: what each one measures and where its numbers come from |
| [conventions.md](conventions.md) | Naming, versioning, commit, and release preferences |
| [pitfalls.md](pitfalls.md) | Traps already hit and how to avoid them |

Start with `README.md` (English) or `README_ZH.md` (Chinese) for the user-facing
view, then come here for implementation detail.

## One-paragraph summary

EasySB is a single static Go binary that deploys and operates a five-protocol
sing-box server on Linux. It replaces the legacy bash implementation with a
full-screen bubbletea TUI. Persistent state lives in
`/etc/sing-box/easysb.conf`, accounts live in
`/etc/sing-box/easysb-users.json`, readable config samples live under
`templates/`, and releases are published by cross-compiling in GitHub Actions
under the tag `v<VERSION>`. The same binaries are wrapped into `.deb` files and an
apt repository (`make deb` / `make apt-index`), published on the fixed `debian`
tag.
