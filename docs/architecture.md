# Architecture

EasySB is one Go module rooted at the repository root. Everything the running
program needs is compiled into a single static binary: the sing-box core is a
module requirement (`internal/sbcore`) and certificates are issued in process
through `github.com/go-acme/lego/v5`. A running panel therefore fetches nothing at
all — no core archive, no `acme.sh`, no socat. The only downloads left are the
panel's own release (`internal/update`) and the optional BBR kernel packages
(`internal/bbr`).

`templates/` is documentation and reference material. The subscription templates
actually used at runtime are embedded from `internal/subscribe/tun-fakeip.json`
and `internal/subscribe/mihomo.yaml` via `//go:embed`; keep each pair in sync when
editing.

## Runtime data

| Path | Owner | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/etc/sing-box/easysb.conf` | `internal/state` | persisted node state, legacy-compatible KV |
| `/etc/sing-box/config.json` | `internal/config` | rendered server config |
| `/etc/sing-box/cert/` | `internal/cert` | the self-signed placeholder pair, used until a real certificate is issued |
| `/etc/sing-box/easysb-users.json` | `internal/user` | accounts: credentials, quotas, expiry and counters (`0600`) |
| `/etc/systemd/system/easysb.service` or `/etc/init.d/easysb` | `internal/service` | subscription service unit (`easysb --serve`) |
| `/etc/systemd/system/sing-box.service` or `/etc/init.d/sing-box` | `internal/service` | core service unit |
| `/etc/sing-box/acme/` | `internal/cert` | ACME state, overridable with `EASYSB_ACME_DIR`: `account.key` and `account.json` (`0600`), then one directory per domain holding `fullchain.cer` (`0644`) and `private.key` (`0600`) |
| `/etc/sysctl.d/99-easysb-bbr.conf`, `/etc/modules-load.d/easysb-bbr.conf` | `internal/bbr` | BBR settings EasySB writes itself, so they never collide with the kernel project's own drop-in; the sysctl file carries a comment recording the values it replaced, which is what the clear action restores. The installed kernel packages (`minimaxflora-bbrv3`) belong to dpkg and are removed through apt |
| `/etc/sing-box/easysb-ui.conf` | `internal/prefs` | interface choices (skin, palette, marker set, language), `0644`, overridable with `EASYSB_UI_CONF` |
| `/etc/systemd/system/easysb-acme.timer` or `/etc/init.d/easysb-acme` | `internal/cert` | certificate renewal: the panel issues and renews through lego in process, so this unit is the only thing that renews, and `--renew-certs` reloads the services afterwards. The unit names the path of the binary that wrote it, so it is installed from inside the panel (or with `--install-renew-timer`) rather than copied between hosts |

## Packages

| Package | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| `internal/tui` | bubbletea model, full-screen dashboard, menu tree, forms, panels, progress |
| `internal/state` | read/write `easysb.conf`; protocol keys, default ports, default parameters |
| `internal/config` | render the sing-box server configuration from state |
| `internal/sbcore` | the core compiled in: `Run` (the node, `easysb core run`), `Check` (config acceptance by the real engine), `Version`, and the `with_v2ray_api` capability as a tagged file pair |
| `internal/download` | the one HTTP-to-file path left: the panel's own release and the BBR kernel packages, with progress readings |
| `internal/cert` | ACME issuance in process through lego (HTTP-01 standalone): the account, issue/renew/remove certificates, expiry decisions, the renewal timer unit, the self-signed fallback |
| `internal/prefs` | remember and re-apply the interface choices: skin, palette, marker set, language |
| `internal/firewall` | Hysteria2 port-hopping DNAT rules and the boot restore unit |
| `internal/bbr` | BBR: read the running kernel's congestion control state, enable it through sysctl drop-ins (recording what they replaced so clearing can undo them), and install the prebuilt BBRv3 kernels published by Linux-BBR-v3 (release/tag discovery, mirror fallback, dpkg) |
| `internal/user` | account model and store: per-protocol credentials, quota/expiry evaluation, subscription tokens |
| `internal/subd` | subscription HTTP service: TLS, User-Agent negotiation, response headers, accounting loop |
| `internal/stats` | gRPC client for the core's `StatsService`, usage accounting, quota enforcement |
| `internal/subscribe` | subscription URLs, per-protocol share links, QR payloads, and the sing-box JSON, mihomo YAML and v2rayN base64 documents for one account |
| `internal/secret` | random UUID / password / Reality keypair generation |
| `internal/service` | systemd and OpenRC detection, install, start/stop, status |
| `internal/sysinfo` | host/device/core/service status for the dashboard: local IPv4/IPv6, CPU cores, load, memory, swap, disk and uptime |
| `internal/netutil` | small network helpers (public IPv4-first IP detection, host resolution) |
| `internal/uninstall` | remove the deployment while keeping the issued certificates |
| `internal/update` | self-update from the GitHub release tag `v<version>` |
| `internal/unlock` | service-unlock probes: whether this IP can use ChatGPT, Netflix, Disney+, YouTube Premium, Prime Video, TikTok, Spotify, Reddit, Steam, 巴哈姆特動畫瘋 and the Bilibili catalogues, each verdict from a small HTTP request and never an optimistic guess |
| `internal/i18n` | `C` / `E` bilingual string table |
| `internal/icons` | single-column Unicode symbol palette, `EASYSB_ICONS=ascii` falls back to ASCII |
| `internal/theme` | dark / light color palettes and frame/column layout helpers |

## Program flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["main.go: parse argv"] --> N["core run|check|version: sbcore"]
    A --> B["i18n.Parse language"]
    B --> C["tui.New(version, lang)"]
    C --> D["tea.NewProgram alt-screen"]
    A --> E["--apply-firewall: firewall.Apply + WriteUnit"]
    A --> F["--render: print Snapshot then exit"]
    A --> G["--version: print version line"]
    A --> H["--serve: subd.Options.Run (HTTP + accounting)"]
    A --> I["--unlock: unlock report on stdout"]
```

`core` is the only subcommand: `core run -c <config>` is the node the service
unit starts, `core check` validates a configuration with the same engine, and
`core version` prints the sing-box release this binary carries.

The TUI is a tree of `menu` and `node` values (`internal/tui/menu.go`). Leaves
carry an `actionFunc`; branches carry a `sub *menu`. Actions call the domain
packages and report back through the app's log/progress channel.

## Deploy path

1. `internal/user` loads the accounts and generates the credentials every enabled
   protocol needs.
2. `internal/cert` resolves or issues a certificate.
3. `internal/config` renders `/etc/sing-box/config.json` from the node state, the
   accounts that may be live and the templates. The `experimental.v2ray_api` block
   is included only when `sbcore.StatsCapable()` says this build carries the API.
4. `internal/sbcore` accepts or refuses the rendered document: the same engine that
   would serve it builds it and closes it again, so a config the node cannot start
   never reaches the service.
5. `internal/service` installs and starts the `sing-box.service` unit, which runs
   this panel in node mode (`easysb core run -c …`).
6. The operator installs `easysb.service` from `订阅管理`; `easysb --serve`
   answers subscriptions and accounts traffic.

State is written after each successful step, so a partial deployment can be
resumed.

## Subscription endpoints

`internal/subd` serves one endpoint, `/sub/<token>`, from the built-in service
(`easysb --serve`); `internal/nginx` is gone. The token belongs to one account
and the response format is negotiated from the User-Agent, so a client never has
to choose between three addresses.

| Path | Body | Content type | Client |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/sub/<token>` | sing-box JSON profile | `application/json` | sing-box (SFM / SFA / SFI) |
| `/sub/<token>` | mihomo YAML profile | `text/yaml` | mihomo / Clash Meta, luci-app-nikki |
| `/sub/<token>` | Base64 share-link document | `text/plain` | v2rayN, passwall, passwall2, homeproxy |

The Base64 document is the universal format: every client above either reads the
Base64 share links directly or base64-decodes the document first.
`luci-app-nikki` runs the mihomo core and validates the subscription for a
top-level `proxies` key, so it consumes the mihomo profile.
Share links keep the canonical hyphenated UUID because homeproxy rejects the
32-character hyphen-less form through its LuCI `uuid` validation.

The service also reports usage in `Subscription-Userinfo`, so a client can show
"used up" or "expired" without parsing the profile, and refuses an account that
is disabled, expired or over quota with `403` and a plain-text reason instead of
serving a profile with no nodes in it.

`subscribe.ClientLink` builds the QR payload. sing-box wraps the URL in its
deep link (`sing-box://import-remote-profile?url=`) because that is what its
scanner expects. mihomo / Clash Meta and v2rayN get the plain URL: Clash-family
scanners pass the scanned text straight to their HTTP client, so a
`clash://install-config?url=` deep link would fail to fetch.
